# My presentation

I put my presentations source code in this repository.
Feel free to change and redistribute my presentations.

# Build PDF from latex

Build all presentations:

```bash
make
```

Build specific directory:
```bash
make -C what_is_lug/
```

Anyway you can download pdfs from [releases](https://github.com/alirezaarzehgar/my-presentations/releases).

# Create new presentation

I prepared a simple script to creating base files of a presentation.

```
./create_new.sh presentation_name
```

# Good themes
